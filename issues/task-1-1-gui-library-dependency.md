## Description
Integrate chosen GUI library (e.g., SDL2) into the CMake build system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update `CMakeLists.txt` to find and link GUI library
- [ ] Add platform-specific library detection (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- [ ] Document library installation instructions in README
- [ ] Project builds successfully with new dependency
- [ ] CI/CD workflow updated to install GUI library dependencies

## Rationale
Setting up dependencies first ensures all subsequent tasks can build upon a working foundation.

## Estimated Effort
2-4 hours

## Phase
Phase 1: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Dependencies
None - This is a foundational task
